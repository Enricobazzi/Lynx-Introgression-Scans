# Lynx-Introgression-Scans

In this repository you can find all of the workflows and scripts I wrote and ran in order to detect introgressed windows in the genomes of *Lynx pardinus* and *Lynx lynx* populations.

The repository is divided into subfolders, where all of the stages of the analysis are described and the respective scripts are stored.

The overall workflow was performed as follows:
